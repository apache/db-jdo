This is the DTD defining the Java Data Objects 1.0 metadata.

The metadata must declare all persistence-capable classes. If any 
field declarations are not provided in the metadata, then field 
metadata is defaulted for the missing field declarations. 
Therefore, the JDO implementation is able to determine based on the
metadata whether a class is persistence-capable or not. 
Any class not known to be persistence-capable by the JDO 
specification (for example, java.lang.Integer) and not explicitly 
named in the metadata is not persistence-capable. 

The metadata associated with each persistence capable class must 
be contained within a file, and its format is as defined in the DTD. 
If the metadata is for only one class, then its file name should be 
<class-name>.jdo. If the metadata is for a package, then its file name 
should be <package-name>.jdo. For portability, files should be 
available via resources loaded by the same class loader as the class. 
These rules apply both to enhancement and to runtime.

The metadata is used both at enhancement time and at runtime. 
Information required at enhancement time is a subset of the information 
needed at runtime.
