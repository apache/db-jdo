method \nPersistenceManagerFactory getPersistenceManagerFactory(Map props). \nThe class "{0}"\n\
defines a non-static getPersistenceManagerFactory(Map props) method.
EXC_GetPMFClassCastException: The PersistenceManagerFactory class must define a static \
method \nPersistenceManagerFactory getPersistenceManagerFactory(Map props). \nThe class "{0}"\n\
has the wrong return type for the getPersistenceManagerFactory(Map props) method.
