/**
 * FetchGroup represents a named fetch group for a specific class or 
 * interface. A fetch group instance identifies the name of the class or 
 * interface, the list of members (fields or properties) to be fetched when 
 * the fetch group is active, and the recursion depth for each member.
 * <p> 
 * Fetch groups are updated using methods on this interface. An instance of
 * a class implementing this interface can be obtained from
 * {@link PersistenceManager#getFetchGroup} or
 * {@link PersistenceManagerFactory#getFetchGroup}.
 * <p> 
 * A FetchGroup can be unscoped or can be in one of two scopes (the 
 * {@link PersistenceManager} or the {@link PersistenceManagerFactory} scope). 
 * Unscoped FetchGroups do not affect any behavior.
 * A FetchGroup in PersistenceManager scope hides the corresponding 
 * FetchGroup in the PersistenceManagerFactory scope.
 * <ul><li>When a FetchGroup is obtained via 
 * {@link PersistenceManager#getFetchGroup},
 * it is immediately in scope of its <code>PersistenceManager</code>.
 * Subsequent modifications of the FetchGroup
 * immediately affect <code>FetchPlan</code>s that contain the
 * <code>FetchGroup</code>.
 * </li><li>When a FetchGroup is obtained via 
 * {@link PersistenceManagerFactory#getFetchGroup}, it is unscoped.
 * </li><li>When a FetchGroup is added to the set of active FetchGroups via
 * {@link PersistenceManagerFactory#addFetchGroups}, it is put in scope of the
 * <code>PersistenceManagerFactory</code>. 
 * </li><li>When a FetchGroup is removed from the set of active FetchGroups via
 * {@link PersistenceManagerFactory#removeFetchGroups}, 
 * {@link PersistenceManagerFactory#removeAllFetchGroups}, or replaced via
 * {@link PersistenceManagerFactory#addFetchGroups}, it is unscoped.
 * </li></ul>
