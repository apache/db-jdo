 * control should be used for the current transaction, whether instances
 * may hold values in the cache outside transactions, and whether
 * values should be retained in the cache after transaction completion.  These
 * options are valid for both managed and non-managed transactions.

 * environment. When used in a managed environment, transaction initiation 
 * and completion methods may only be used with bean-managed transaction 
 * semantics.
