/**
 * This interface is implemented by classes that can be detached from the
 * persistence context and later attached. The interface includes the 
 * contract by which the StateManager can set the object id, version,
 * BitSet of loaded fields, and BitSet of modified fields 
 * so they are preserved while outside the persistence environment.
 * <P>The detached state is stored as a field in each instance of Detachable. 
 * The field is serialized so as to maintain the state of the instance 
 * while detached. While detached, only the BitSet of modified fields 
 * will be modified. The structure of the Object[] jdoDetachedState
 * is as follows:
 *  <ul><li>jdoDetachedState[0]: the Object Id of the instance
 * </li><li>jdoDetachedState[1]: the Version of the instance
 * </li><li>jdoDetachedState[2]: a BitSet of loaded fields
 * </li><li>jdoDetachedState[3]: a BitSet of modified fields
 * </li></ul>
 * @version 2.0
