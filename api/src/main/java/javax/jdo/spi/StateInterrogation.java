/**
 * This interface is implemented by a non-binary-compatible JDO implementation
 * to provide state interrogation for non-enhanced persistent classes.
 *
 * <P>A call to JDOHelper to get the status of an instance is handled
 * internally if the parameter instance implements PersistenceCapable. 
 * For non-binary-compatible implementations, there is no requirement
 * that persistent instances implement PersistenceCapable. Therefore,
 * if the parameter does not implement PersistenceCapable, JDOHelper
 * delegates to all registered instances of StateInterrogation until
 * an instance can handle the request.
 * <P>For JDOHelper isXXX methods, which return boolean, the 
 * corresponding method in StateInterrogation returns Boolean. If the
 * return value is <code>null</code> then the StateInterrogation does
 * not recognize the parameter as being handled by it. A non-null return
 * value indicates that the implementation has determined the answer.
 * <P>For JDOHelper getXXX methods, which return an Object, each
 * registered StateInterrogation is given the parameter until one of 
 * them returns a non-null value, which is passed to the caller.
 * <P>For JDOHelper makeDirty, each
 * registered StateInterrogation is given the parameter until one of 
 * them returns true, indicating that it has handled the call.
 * An instance that implements this interface must be registered with the
 * {@link JDOImplHelper}.
