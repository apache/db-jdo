<body>
This package contains the JDO specification listener interfaces and classes.
<P>There are two kinds of interfaces defined to allow an application to 
manage life cycle changes to persistent objects. 
<P>The first kind is defined
on the persistent domain class itself. This allows methods in the domain class
to be called during life cycle events. The domain class implements one or more
of the interfaces 
{@link javax.jdo.listener.AttachCallback}, 
{@link javax.jdo.listener.ClearCallback}, 
{@link javax.jdo.listener.DeleteCallback}, 
{@link javax.jdo.listener.DetachCallback},
{@link javax.jdo.listener.LoadCallback}, or 
{@link javax.jdo.listener.StoreCallback}. 
The methods in the interfaces
are called during life cycle events.
<P>The second kind is defined on an external class using the listener pattern.
Instances of classes that implement one or more of the listener interfaces 
{@link javax.jdo.listener.AttachLifecycleListener}, 
{@link javax.jdo.listener.ClearLifecycleListener}, 
{@link javax.jdo.listener.CreateLifecycleListener}, 
{@link javax.jdo.listener.DeleteLifecycleListener}, 
{@link javax.jdo.listener.DetachLifecycleListener}, 
{@link javax.jdo.listener.DirtyLifecycleListener}, 
{@link javax.jdo.listener.LoadLifecycleListener}, or 
{@link javax.jdo.listener.StoreLifecycleListener}
are registered
with the PersistenceManager or PersistenceManagerFactory
and receive callbacks during life cycle events
of the persistent instances of interest.
