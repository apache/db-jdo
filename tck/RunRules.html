<P>In order to demonstrate compliance with the Java Data Objects
specification, an implementation must successfully run all of the TCK
tests that are not on the &quot;excluded&quot; list. The
implementation is hereinafter referred to as the IUT (Implementation
Under Test).</P>
<P>The results must be posted on a publicly accessible web site for
examination by the public. The posting includes the output of the
test run, which consists of multiple log files containing
configuration information and test results. For an example of the
required posting, please see <A HREF="http://db.apache.org/jdo/tck/final">http://db.apache.org/jdo/tck/final</A>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Prerequisites</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>In order to run the TCK, you must install Maven 2.x
M<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">aven

</FONT></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">is the</FONT>
driver of the test programs.</P>
<P>You must test the IUT on all configurations that the IUT supports.
This includes different hardware and operating systems, different
versions of Java, and different datastores. The TCK supports Java
versions 1.5 to 1.6. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Installation</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Download the jdo.3.x-src.zip or jdo.3.x-src.gz file from the distribution location.  Unpack the archive file into a directory of your choice.
Follow the instructions in the root level README.html file for building and running the JDO TCK.
Please take note of the following files:
</P>
<UL>
	<UL>
		</P>
		<LI><P>Maven configuration file "pom.xml"
		in the top level directory and subprojects.
		These files must not be changed.</P>
		<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">lib/ext - 
		Copy the jar files fscontext.jar and providerutil.jar used by the JNDI tests
		into this directory. 
		It is permitted to use a different JNDI implementation; see
		README.html for more information.
		</P>
		<LI><P>lib/iut - this directory is where the JDO implementation
		jars are installed. It is empty in the distribution. To use the
		maven target runtck (required for an implementation to prove
		compliance), copy the JDO implementation jar files into this
		directory. Alternatively, update the build.properties file in the
		TCK directory to refer to an existing location of the IUT jar
		files.</P>
		<LI><P>the TCK directory, which contains:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P>assertions - contains the assertions file identifying the
			assertions tested by the tests. This is for reference.</P>
			<LI><P>target - this directory contains artifacts of compiling and
			running the tests. It does not exist in the distribution and will
			be created by the maven build process.</P>
			<LI><P>src - this directory contains the test configuration files
			and directories:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI><P>testdata - this directory contains data (represented as
				.xml files) loaded into the datastore for tests. These files must
				not be modified.</P>
				<LI><P>sql - this directory contains DDL to define the tables
				used in the tests. The files distributed must not be modified.
				Files may be created for databases for which the DDL for the
				database under test is not provided. 
				</P>
				<LI><P>jdo - this directory contains .jdo metadata files for the
				persistent classes used in the tests. These files must not be
				modified.</P>
				<LI><P>orm - this directory contains .orm metadata files to map
                the persistent classes to the sql tables. These files must not
                be modified except to add DDL-generation information
                (which is not used by the TCK).</P>
				<LI><P>java - this directory contains the source code to the TCK
				tests. These files must not be modified.</P>
				<LI><P>conf - this directory contains the configuration

                iut-jdoconfig.xml, and iut-persistence.xml in this directory
                must be changed to provide properties for the IUT persistence
                manager factory.  The file jndi.properties may be changed
                to use a different jndi provider. Other files must not be
				modified, except to put a successfully challenged test case into
				the trunk/tck20/test/conf/exclude.list. Please see below.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Modifying
the Configuration</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The Implementation Under Test (IUT) can be installed into the
lib/iut directory. Any jar files in this
directory are added to the class path used to run the tests.</P>
<P>There are properties in the build.properties file in the TCK
directory that must be changed to configure the IUT execution and
enhancement (optional) environment. These properties begin with
iut.runtck and iut.enhancer. 
</P>
<P>There is are three properties files that must be modified to be
IUT-specific, all located in the TCK src/conf directory. The
iut-pmf.properties file contains information used to construct the
PersistenceManagerFactory used in the tests. iut-jdoconfig.xml and
iut-persistence.xml also contain PersistenceManagerFactory properties
used only in tests in the
org.apache.jdo.tck.api.persistencemanagerfactory.config package.
</P>
<P>SQL DDL files are provided for the sql table definitions. The
existing files must not be changed, but files may be added in the
directory in order to provide DDL for additional databases supported
by the JDO implementation under test.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Running
the Tests</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Follow the instructions in README.html for running the TCK on the JDO Reference Implementation
and the Implementation Under Test.
This will produce console output plus a
directory in the tck/target/logs directory whose name contains the
date/time the tests were started. This directory contains the output
of the tests. This is the directory to be published.</P>
<P>Some of the TCK tests require the implementation to support up to
20 instances of PersistenceManager with open transactions
simultaneously.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Debugging
the IUT while Running TCK tests</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Execute &quot;mvn jdo-exectck:help&quot; in the TCK directory in order to
get information on running the TCK tests with a debugger. In
particular, properties jdo.tck.cleanupaftertest, jdo.tck.cfglist,
jdo.tck.identitytypes, and jdo.tck.dblist may be useful.</P>
<P>If you make a change to the IUT enhancer while debugging the TCK
tests (for implementations that use an enhancer) you must remove the
target/classes directory before continuing in order to make sure that
the classes are re-enhanced by the changed code.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Publishing
the Results of the TCK Tests</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>With a successful test run, the log directory with the results of
the tests must be published on a publicly-available web site. The
unmodified directory is the self-certification of the successful TCK
test run.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>First
Level TCK Appeals Process</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid">If
any test does not pass on the JDO implementation under test, this may
be due to an error in the implementation or in the TCK test. If you
believe that the failure is due to an error in the TCK test, you may
challenge the test. To do so, send email to: <A HREF="mailto:jdo-dev@db.apache.org">jdo-dev@db.apache.org</A>
with a subject line containing &quot;CHALLENGE&quot; and the name of
the test program, e.g.
org.apache.jdo.tck.api.persistencemanager.ThreadSafe.java; and the
body of the email containing the details of the challenge.</P>
<P>The Maintenance Lead will respond within 15 working days with a
decision on whether there is an error in the test case. If the issue
is found by the Maintenance Lead to be due to an error in the test
case, the Maintenance Lead might patch the erroneous test or add the test
to the exclude list.
The user can obtain the TCK updates by checking out the latest minor version branch, 3.n.1.
If a fix is not provided within 15 working days of the receipt of the challenge,
then the user may put the test into the TCK file src/conf/exclude.list and
it will not be run as part of the TCK.</P>
<P>Decisions of the Maintenance Lead may be appealed to the full
expert group. A vote of the full expert group will be conducted by
the Maintenance Lead, and a majority of votes cast will decide the
issue. The Maintenance Lead has one vote, as does each member of the
expert group at the time of the vote.</P>
