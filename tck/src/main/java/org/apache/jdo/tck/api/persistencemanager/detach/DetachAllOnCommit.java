 * <B>Assertion IDs:</B> A12.6.8-3 <br>
 * <B>Assertion Description: </B> With this flag set to true, during beforeCompletion all cached
 * instances are prepared for detachment according to the fetch plan in effect at commit. Loading
 * fields and unload- ing fields required by the fetch plan is done after calling the user's
 * beforeCompletion callback. During afterCompletion, before calling the user's afterCompletion
 * callback, all detachable persistent instances in the cache transition to detached; non-detachable
 * persistent instances transition to transient; and detachable instances can be serialized as
 * detached instances. Transient transactional instances are unaffected by this flag.
